Before downloading and using the .bat file, use must have installed FFmpeg (latest version) installed on your Windows computer. 
Once the .bat file is saved, open it with Notepad++ or your desired notepad program.
After you have opened it, edit the following lines of code: 

set "VIDEO_DIRECTORY=[your directory goes here]"

set "FFMPEG_PATH=[your directory goes here]"

Then save it as .bat file. Then double left click on it.



I hope this is helpful. Good Luck!
